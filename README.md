### AIRbot - Revolutionizing the way logistics work !!!


### The project aimed to develop an AI drone system for autonomous emergency kit delivery. It involved the creation of a quadcopter drone capable of autonomous flight, navigation, and delivery. Additionally, a ### user-friendly mobile app was developed for users to request deliveries, with an administrative web interface for real-time monitoring. The project also emphasized the importance of maintaining comprehensive ### documentation throughout to facilitate future maintenance and improvements.
